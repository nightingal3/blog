title: I'm an NLP Researcher. I didn't check Twitter for a year. It was fine.
subtitle: Bla bla bla
---

(Before anyone who knows me says "wait a minute, I've seen you post things on Twitter!", I have occasionally posted and reposted papers for work reasons more or less, but for more or less a year, I haven't opened Twitter to browse through new posts at all. This is what I mean by "I didn't check Twitter for a year".)

I am also not a Twitter personality or famous for my work, if I were, the tradeoffs would change a bit and I may not have ever made this post. I'm speaking as just an ordinary researcher who uses Twitter to post my work/friends' works and to keep up with the literature, which I think describes a large segment of students and researchers. If you also fit in this demographic, the approach I outline may work for you.

<i>TL;DR: Experiencing the typical mid-PhD ennui, I lose interest in keeping up with Twitter and stuff in general, and surprisingly I find that I don't really miss it. Some more thoughts on a slower way to read literature and think of ideas.</i>

## The requisite existential crisis {#existential-crisis}

Feel free to skip this section if you don't feel like reading about my personal circumstances or general moping. To be honest, I didn't really want to write this section either, but I couldn't think of a way to honestly present my motivations for this personal experiment without giving a bit of background context on my life. Again, I wouldn't mind (would even prefer maybe?) if you skip this section, but who knows, maybe some might also find this useful/relatable?

I haven't really been productive in terms of research this year. At least for the semester of the academic year, I didn't really publish any first-author papers or have any ideas that I was really excited about. I had some co-authored papers on which I was either working on or mentoring others on, but to be honest, I don't think my heart was really in any of those projects either. 

From this perspective, every time I opened Twitter, it was like the universe was laughing at me -- <i>Everyone is publishing high-impact research except for you! Enjoy graduating in 7+ years, if you even can!</i> I usually get somewhat excited by new ideas, but over time, the cost started to outweigh the reward for me, so I started avoiding Twitter, or even discussing new ideas with people in real life. I wouldn't recommend the second half of the previous sentence, though as you can guess from the title, I don't really miss Twitter. 

Second, I also got mono last semester, which reduced my productivity even more and restricted my working hours. I usually started feeling extremely tired by 8pm, which isn't great when there were many days when I would have research or classes straight from 9am-5pm. I did what I could basically, and that was the projects I already started and felt obligated to work on. But this also fed into the first point in this section and further strengthened the assertion that I was going nowhere fast. 

Basically, all of this combined with the fact that I wanted to pivot my research (and also needed to potentially link all of my past research together in a proposal soon) created conditions in which I had no time to really scroll Twitter/read papers there, and also didn't have any incentive to do so even if I had time.


## What purpose does Twitter serve? {#twitter-uses}

My claim is that for people that are non-famous and mostly using Twitter to keep up with research or occasionally post their own, Twitter can almost entirely be replaced by different, and possibly better alternatives. Let's examine some different benefits and alternatives one-by-one:

1. Keeping up with the literature 
 * Finding things related to your research projects
 * Finding things unrelated to your research projects

2. Promoting your own work

3. Finding opportunities 

4. Building your own brand/image

5. Meeting new people

6. Having fun/feeling productive

## Returning to Twitter (mindfully) {#returning-to-twitter}

If you've read this far, it probably seems strange for me to now say that I'm returning to Twitter after listing out all the reasons
