I'm currently a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. I work on natural language processing and am interested in cognitive science and machine learning as well. You can also find me on my main [academic site](https://nightingal3.github.io) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/_emliu).

This blog contains some ideas that aren't fully fleshed out and also probably will not make it into research papers, as well as notes and explanations of concepts I've learned about. Some general advice for life and research may or may not sneak its way in as well...
