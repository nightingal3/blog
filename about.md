I'm currently a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. I work on natural language processing and am interested in cognitive science and machine learning as well. You can also find me on my main [academic site](https://nightingal3.github.io) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/_emliu).
